##  Installation and Configuration

### Setup Environment 

#### Windows

You can install [Laragon](https://laragon.org/download/) or [Homestead](https://laravel.com/docs/5.8/homestead). I have had problems installing Homestead on Windows in the past, so it might not be the best option. If you use Laragon watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pQSt9ST22A) after installing it. It will show you how to create your first Laravel application

#### Mac 

Firstly you need to install [homebrew](https://brew.sh), then we are going to use Laravel Valet so just follow its [installation guide](https://laravel.com/docs/5.8/valet#installation). When finish you will have installed [homebrew](https://brew.sh), php and [composer](https://getcomposer.org/) and Laravel Valet in your machine.
