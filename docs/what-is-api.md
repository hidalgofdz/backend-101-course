API is an acronym for Application Programming Interface. A piece of software is called an APi when it has a list of close related functions or features that allows you to do something without having to implement them yourself. An API can be a set of functions inside a directory, a module (like in npm), a jar (cof cof java) or a service which you can send requests using something like HTTP or Websockets. In addition, an API can be used to limit the access to certain resources or to limit what an user can do depending of her role.

In web development there is a large number of available APIs that can be used to create applications without having to reinvent the wheel. For example, there are APIs for Authentication (Google, Auth0), Maps (Google Maps), payment processing (conekta, stripe), etc. For this reason, a team can create an API MVP really fast.
